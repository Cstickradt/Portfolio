    		My Name is Cody Ray Stickradt and this is my first attempt at coding in my life. I decided to combine my three critera into my first webpage. As my submission for standard one I've also compiled into this page the rest of the standards required by the portfolio submission. I would have liked to add more css and javascript elements, but given the constraints of time between my family and my work, I fell short of my goal to make a more constructed web page.

						<p>	This is my submission for the second option of the third standard. This is a small portion of footage I've edited using Filmora video editor, as you can clearly see by the enormous and impossible to miss watermark. Video editing is also a first for me. With my drive to and from Denver I work no less than 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. I am driven to change my life and build things with my mind instead of my body. </p>

					<p>	"All your base are belong to us" is a reference from Zero Wing, which is from the 1992 Mega Drive port of the arcade release of Zero Wing in 1989. The game features poorly translated text from the original japanese version, and has such becoming a lengendary line in gaming.</p>
